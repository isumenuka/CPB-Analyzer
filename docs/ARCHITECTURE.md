# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Image Prompt Generator is built using a modern React architecture with TypeScript. It follows a component-based structure with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Technologies

- **React**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Static typing
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Google Gemini API**: AI image analysis
- **Vite**: Build tool

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Component Architecture

- **Atomic Design**: Components are organized following atomic design principles
- **Modular Structure**: Each component is self-contained with its own types and styles
- **Reusable Components**: Common UI elements are abstracted into reusable components

### 2. State Management

- **React Context**: Used for global state (errors, themes)
- **Local State**: Component-specific state using hooks
- **Custom Hooks**: Complex state logic extracted into custom hooks

### 3. Error Handling

- **Global Error System**: Centralized error handling through ErrorProvider
- **Type-Safe Errors**: Strongly typed error objects
- **User-Friendly Display**: Toast-style error notifications

### 4. API Integration

- **Gemini Vision API**: Used for image analysis
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling for API failures

## Data Flow

1. User uploads image(s)
2. Images are processed and validated
3. Gemini API analyzes images
4. Results are formatted into prompts
5. Final prompt is generated and displayed

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Images are processed before upload
- **Debounced Operations**: Prevent excessive API calls
- **Memoization**: Heavy computations are cached
